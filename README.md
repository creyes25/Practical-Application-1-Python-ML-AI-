# Project Summary: Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

---

## Objective

Determine key factors that influeces people whether a person accepts a mobile coupon while driving

---

## Summary of Findings

After cleaning and analyzing the data, I focused on analyzing **coffee house coupon acceptance based on driving destination**

I discovered:

- Drivers with "no urgent place" as their destination were most likely to accept the coffe house coupon, compared to heading home or work. 
- The acceptance rate analysis was done by aggregating and comparing coupon responses based on destination types. 

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

- Look at the different coupon types to see if drivers has the same correlation as those drivers that their destination is not urgent.
- Coffee House owners should prioritize sending coupons to drivers not heading to an urgent destinations.
- Test different combinations of features (like time & passenger) influece coupon acceptace rate.
